I'm a passionate freelance software developer from Salerno. <br/>
Since last year my works concerned the design and develop of some DBs and back-end software, especially RESTful web service, using Node.js and MongoDB. <br />
I'm having fun to learn new technologies, new web frameworks (both back-end and front-end) and new programming languages, due to my (natural) curiosity and passion for my job, but my main passion is Computer Science.

I'm also spending time to learn other discipline like marketing, web design and human-computer interaction.

I graduated cum laude in Computer Science at Università degli Studi di Salerno and actually I'm studing for my Master's Degree in Reti e Tecnologie Software (Networks and Software Technologies) at Università degli Studi di Salerno. <br />
I did my Bachelor's thesis on Streaming Graph Partitioning.
