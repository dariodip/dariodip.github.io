I am a passionate freelance developer from Salerno. <br/>
I have worked as a back-end developer for three years, using both Javascript (Node.js) and Python as languages, and both NoSQL (MongoDB) and SQL databases. I have occasionally worked as a front-end or mobile developer, even though I prefer back-end. <br/> 
At present I am working as a Backend Engineer and Smart Contract Developer. <br/>
I enjoy learning new technologies, new frameworks and new programming languages, but actually, my main passions are Computer Science and solving hard problems. <br/>
I am currently focused on Blockchain Technologies, Smart Contract development and DSLs development. <br/>
I graduated cum laude in Computer Science at Università degli Studi di Salerno and I'm currently studing for my Master's Degree in Networks and Software Technologies.<br/>
I did my Bachelor's thesis on Streaming Graph Partitioning. <br/>
