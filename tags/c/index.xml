      <description>The Binary Search Algorithm This page has been migrated to Medium The Binary Search Algorithm is a search algorithm that works for sorted collections (e.g. sorted arrays). It takes as input a collection, the length of that collection and an element to find, and gives as output the index of the element in the collection (if it exists).
This algorithm is as efficient as easy to learn due to its simplicity.</description>
