I am a passionate freelance software developer from Salerno. <br/>
I have worked as a back-end developer for two years, using both Javascript (Node.js) and Python as languages, and both NoSQL (MongoDB) and SQL databases. I have occasionally worked as a front-end or mobile developer, even though I prefer back-end. <br/>
I enjoy learning new technologies, new frameworks (not only for web) and new programming languages, but my main passion is Computer Science. <br/>
I am actually focusing on microservices and blockchain technologies. <br/>
I graduated cum laude in Computer Science at Università degli Studi di Salerno and I'm actually studing for my Master's Degree in Networks and Software Technologies. <br/>
I did my Bachelor's thesis on Streaming Graph Partitioning.
