<p>It is not too detailed about some advanced aspects, but a rich bibliografy and a good style of writing compensate it. Martin Kleppman is a researcher and you can find it reading the book.</p>
<p>I liked it so much!</p>

<p>This book provides repeatable, generic patterns, and reusable components to make developing reliable systems easier and more efficient—so you can free your time to focus on core development of your app.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learnt so much from this book and it is a great reference for me during my work.</p>

<p>Leaning a new programming language is always a new challenge.</p>
<p>You could extrapolate some best practices and approaches that you could bring to your everyday work life, also using other programming languages.</p>
<p>Recently I have read Elixir in Action and I&rsquo;ve found it a very interesting book.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I will ever work with Elixir but I like this language. I like the clearness and the power of the BEAM platform which has been brought back to our times by Elixir in a fancy and modernized style.</p>

<p>This was the first book about architecture I have read and, you know, truly first love is not forgotten.</p>
<p>Some of those patterns are now deprecated but the book is still a good guide to learn how to read and analyze architectures.</p>
