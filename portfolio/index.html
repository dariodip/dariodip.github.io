<h3 id="fly-https-github-com-spagnuolocarmine-fly-language"><a href="https://github.com/spagnuolocarmine/FLY-language/">FLY</a></h3>

<h4 id="jul-2018-feb-2019">Jul 2018 - Feb 2019</h4>

<p>FLY is an open source Domain Specific Language for scientific computing on the cloud exploiting Function-as-a-Service.</p>

<p>FLY is designed as a scripting language that uses the local machine or a cloud infrastructure as the run-time environment. The script automates the execution of tasks that could alternatively be executed one-by-one by a human operator. The goal of FLY is to provide a portable, scalable and easy-to-use programming environment for scientific computing. FLY perceives a cloud computing infrastructure as a parallel computing architecture on which it is possible to execute some parts of its execution flow in parallel. FLY enables users (domain experts with limited knowledge about complex parallel and distributed systems) to design their applications exploiting data and task parallelism on any FaaS architecture. This is achieved by a rich language that provides domain-specific constructs, that enables the users to easily interact, using an environment abstraction, with different FaaS backends.</p>

<p>FLY is written using Xtext a framework for the development of programming languages and domain-specific languages. The FLY code is transformed in pure Java code that you can run on a Java Virtual Machine and/or in JavaScript (Node.js) and Python code that you can run on a FaaS backend.</p>

<p>I developed the Python generator for my Master&rsquo;s thesis.</p>

<p>The project was developed at <a href="http://www.isislab.it/">ISISLab</a>.</p>

<h4 id="apr-2018-jul-2018">Apr 2018 - Jul 2018</h4>

<p>prefix-search is an implementation of the algorithm introduced in the <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-40450-4_40">paper</a> <em>Compressed Cache-Oblivious String B-tree</em> of Paolo Ferragina and Rossano Venturini.</p>

<p>We developed the proposed algorithm (LPRC) and a new one (PSRC), giving you the ability to deal with online dictionaries of strings in an unspecified order.</p>

<p>The project was developed using <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> for the core of the algorithm and Python for the random test generator and the analysis of the results.</p>

<p>We also used <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a> for Continuous Integration, in order to test our project at each new commit and pull request.</p>

<p>The project was developed together with <a href="https://github.com/mattiatomeo">Mattia Tomeo</a>.</p>

<h3 id="gittogit-https-github-com-dariodip-gittogit"><a href="https://github.com/dariodip/gittogit">gittogit</a></h3>

<h4 id="dec-2017-mar-2018">Dec 2017 - Mar 2018</h4>

<p>gittogit is a simple implementation of the git protocol using a peer-to-peer network as a storage. The storage is, indeed, a Distributed Hash Table (DHT). We used Tomp2p as DHT library.
Each client can:</p>

<ol>
<li>create a repository in a directory;</li>
<li>commit the repository (if there were changes);</li>
<li>add new files not yet tracked;</li>
<li>pull and push its repository on the DHT. The system will notify the user in case of conflicts (e.g. pulling a modified repository, and so on).</li>
</ol>

<p>Along with Tomp2p we used Travis CI for Continuous Integration, jUnit for Unit Tests, TextIO for reading and writing text and for the CLI.</p>

<p>The project was developed together with <a href="https://github.com/dariocast">Dario Castellano</a>.</p>

<h4 id="mar-2017-jun-2017">Mar 2017 - Jun 2017</h4>

<p>WSIL is a web app giving the opportunity to check out trending of programming languages and frameworks. Using WSIL you can both see jobs for a given programming language or framework, with courses concern it.</p>

<p>On WSIL you can find statistics to closely analyze up to 200 programming languages and up to 100 frameworks.</p>

<p>For each programming language and framework, you can find:</p>

<ul>
<li>count of StackOverflow answers;</li>
<li>jobs for it, obtained from AuthenticJobs and Indeed;</li>
<li>course for it, obtained from Coursera and Udacity;</li>
<li>trend for it in each region and time interval, based on GitHub repositories activity and Google Trends.</li>
</ul>

<p>Data are obtained from the following sources:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wikipedia;</li>
<li>StackOverflow;</li>
<li>GitHub;</li>
<li>AuthenticJobs;</li>
<li>Indeed;</li>
<li>Coursera;</li>
<li>Google Trends;</li>
<li>Udacity.</li>
</ul>

<p>The technology stack is the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Django as back-end, using Django Rest Framework for REST APIs;</li>
<li>Plotly for showing graphs;</li>
<li>Jinja + React + Bootstrap for front-end and UI;</li>
<li>SQLite as a database;</li>
<li>Scrapy for scraping.</li>

<h3 id="rfd-discovery-http-github-com-dariodip-rfd-discovery"><a href="http://github.com/dariodip/rfd-discovery">rfd-discovery </a></h3>

<h4 id="oct-2016-feb-2017">Oct 2016 – Feb 2017</h4>

<p>rfd-discovery is a tool written in Python and Cython using the Scipy stack.
This project deals with the discovery of Relaxed Functional Dependencies(RFDs) using a bottom-up approach: instead of taking a fixed threshold on input and finding all the RFDs, this method infers distances from different RHS attributes by itself and then discovers the RFDs for these ones.</p>

<p>rfd-discovery takes a dataset, representing a relational table, in CSV format as input and prints the set of the discovered RFDs.
We also built a simple page, using AngularJS as frontend and Flask as backend, in order to easily upload CSV files and interactively select right-hand-side and left-hand-side.</p>

<p>The project was developed together with <a href="https://github.com/mattiatomeo">Mattia Tomeo</a> and <a href="https://github.com/antonioaltamura">Antonio Altamura</a>.</p>

<h4 id="apr-2015-jul-2015">Apr 2015 – Jul 2015</h4>

<p>This project was developed for the course in Human Computer Interaction at the University of Salerno. It consists of a small app, developed with C#, for tracking exercise and physical health, aimed at countering obesity. The application, related materials and prototyping activities, are mainly focused on keeping up the principle of usability, based on the main guidelines and heuristics.</p>

<p>The project was developed together with Christian De Blasio, Domenico Iannone and Marco Picariello.</p>
