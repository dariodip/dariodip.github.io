### Data Aggregation Server for IOT (DASI)
#### Jul 2017 - Sep 2017

Designing and developing a dynamic data aggregation server using Python (Flask).
The server can gather data in different formats from many devices (sensors, actuators, etc) and these informations can be accessed in a standard format through HTTP endpoints.
The server can be configured using a file specifying the way in which data from device can be parsed.
Users can set alarms for abnormal measurement and can block endpoints for devices sending invalid or unwanted data.
The technology stack is the following:
- Python Flask;
- JWT;
- MongoDB;
- Redis;
- Docker.

### [WSIL](https://github.com/criticalerrors/WSIL) [(Online on Heroku)](http://wsilang.herokuapp.com/)
#### Mar 2017 - Jun 2017

WSIL is a web app giving the opportunity to check out trending of programming languages and frameworks. Using WSIL you can both see jobs for a given programming language or framework, with courses concern it.
On WSIL you can find statistics to closely analyze up to 200 programming languages and up to 100 frameworks.
For each programming language and framework, you can find:
- count of StackOverflow answers;
- jobs for it, obtained from AuthenticJobs and Indeed;
- course for it, obtained from Coursera and Udacity;
- trend for it in each region and time interval, based on GitHub repositories activity and Google Trends.

Data are obtained from the following sources:
- Wikipedia;
- StackOverflow;
- GitHub;
- AuthenticJobs;
- Indeed;
- Coursera;
- Google Trends;
- Udacity.

The technology stack is the following:

### [rfd-discovery ](http://github.com/dariodip/rfd-discovery)
#### Oct 2016 – Feb 2017

  rfd-discovery is a tool written in Python and Cython using the Scipy stack.
This project deals with the discovery of Relaxed Functional Dependencies(RFDs) using a bottom-up approach: instead of giving a fixed threshold on input and find all the RFDs, this method infers distances from different RHS attributes by itself and then discover the RFDs for these ones.
rfd-discovery takes a dataset, representing a relational table, in CSV format as input and prints the set of the discovered RFDs.
We also built a simple page, using AngularJS and Flask as backend, in order to easily upload CSV files and interactively select right-hand-side and left-hand-side.

### Healthy Weight
#### Apr 2015 – Jul 2015

  Project for the course in Human Computer Interaction at the University of Salerno, on a small app, developed with C#, for exercise and physical health, aimed at countering obesity. The application, related materials and prototyping activities, mainly focused on keeping up the principle of usability, based on the main guidelines and heuristics.
