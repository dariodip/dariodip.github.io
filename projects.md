## University Projects


### [rfd-discovery ](https://www.slideshare.net/DarioDiPasquale/rfddiscovery-italian)
#### Oct 2016 – Feb 2017

  rfd-discovery is a tool written in Python and Cython using the Scipy stack.
This project deals with the discovery of Relaxed Functional Dependencies(RFDs) using a bottom-up approach: instead of giving a fixed threshold on input and find all the RFDs, this method infers distances from different RHS attributes by itself and then discover the RFDs for these ones.
rfd-discovery takes a dataset, representing a relational table, in CSV format as input and prints the set of the discovered RFDs.
We also built a simple page, using AngularJS and Flask as backend, in order to easily upload CSV files and interactively select right-hand-side and left-hand-side.


### Healthy Weight

  Project for the course in Human Computer Interaction at the University of Salerno, on a small app, developed with C#, for exercise and physical health, aimed at countering obesity. The application, related materials and prototyping activities, mainly focused on keeping up the principle of usability, based on the main guidelines and heuristics.
